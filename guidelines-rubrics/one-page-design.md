# Lawley GDD2: One Page Design Summary Document

For each of your three group projects, you will create a one page design summary document. Please watch Stone Librande's 2010 GDC talk [One-Page Designs](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1012356/One-Page) for an overview of what a good single page design document contains. You will submit this document at the same time as your completed prototype, at the end of the design cycle. 

Your one page design document is still a design document. All the key elements one would have in a more traditional design document should still be there. In particular, all of these basic questions should be answered:
* Who is the player? (Objects)
* What can they do? (Behaviors)
* How do they do it? (Mechanics)
* Why are they doing any of it? (Narrative context)
* Where are they doing this thing they are doing? (Narrative context and relationships)


Here's the scoring sheet I'll use for evaluating your document:

| Description | Max Points | 
| --- | --- |
| Game Title and tagline/objective | 5
| Representation of look and feel of the final game | 15
| Win condition | 10
| Obstacles to winning | 10
| Mechanics | 10
| Rules | 10
| Team name and members | 10
| Presentation â€‹Orderliness, Graphics Illustrate ideas, Engaging delivery | 30
