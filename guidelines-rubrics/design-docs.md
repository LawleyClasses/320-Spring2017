# Lawley GDD2: One Page Design Documents

For each of your three group projects, you will begin with a one page design document. Please watch Stone Librande's 2010 GDC talk [One-Page Designs](http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1012356/One-Page) for an overview of what a good single page design document contains. 

Your one page design document is still a design document. All the key elements one would have in a more traditional design document should still be there. In particular, all of these basic questions should be answered:
* Who is the player? (Objects)
* What can they do? (Behaviors)
* How do they do it? (Mechanics)
* Why are they doing any of it? (Narrative context)
* Where are they doing this thing they are doing? (Narrative context and relationships)


Here's the scoring sheet I'll use for evaluating your documents:

| Description | Max Points | 
| --- | --- |
| Game Title and tagline/objective | 5
| Representation of look and feel of the final game | 15
| Win condition | 10
| Obstacles to winning | 10
| Mechanics | 10
| Rules | 10
| Team name and members | 10
| Presentation â€‹Orderliness, Graphics Illustrate ideas, Engaging delivery | 30
