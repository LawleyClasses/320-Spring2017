# Lawley GDD2: Game Prototype

## Analog Prototype Rubric (Project 1)

| Description | Max Points |
| --- | --- |
| **Game Title/Tagline** Should clearly communicate what the game is about | 1 |
| **Rulesheet** Set up, turn actions, and win codition clearly communicated | 3 |
| **Game Objects (Tokens, boards, cards)** Items should be meaningful. Any artwork should communicate look and feel. | 1 |
| **Interaction Clarity** In addition to the rulesheet, the objects communicate their constraints and abilities (for example a cheat sheet with turn actions, rules or mechanics is printed on the game board, card abilities are labeled, there is a space on the mat for discards, or a labeled receptacle for resources like a bank) | 1 |
| **Win Condition** is clearly communicated. (for example A d20 counts down health, n dollars is indicated by a pile of gold tokens, an alarm sounds, there is only one token remaining on the playing fieldâ€¦)  | 1 |
| **Presentation** Craftsmanship counts. Straight lines are straight. Excess glue is cut away. Multiple tokens and cards have a consistent format. Any text is legible. | 3 |
 
 ## Digital  Prototype Rubric (Project 2)

| Description | Max Points |
| --- | --- |
| **Title Screen/Tagline** Should clearly communicate what the game is about through words and images | 1 |
| **Tutorial/Introduction** Gameplay mechanics, goals, and win condition clearly communicated | 2 |
| **Game Mechanics** Rules/constraints, player actions, game behavior all make sense and fucntion properly . | 3 |
| **Interaction Clarity** Beyond any written instructions or tutorials, the game itself communicates its possibilities and constraints clearly. The interface is well-designed to support the mechanics and actions. | 2 |
| **Presentation** Craftsmanship counts. Graphics are reasonably polished and complete. Interface elements fit well with the look and feel of the game itself. Text is easily legible. | 2 |
