# Lawley GDD2: Project 2

Your second project will be to design a digital game for visitors to GCVM. You must clearly define in your planning document the specific demographic you're designing for. Young kids? Middle school/high school? Young Adults? Parents? Teachers? You should also indicate whether you are designing something intended to educate (in whcih case you should specify learning objectives) or entertain (in which case you should specify context and use case of where/why your intended audience would play it).

You should also specify the platform (either computers or mobile devices, but not consoles), and the technology you plan to use (Unity? node.js? Something else?)
