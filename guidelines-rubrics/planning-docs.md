# Lawley GDD2: Planning Documents

At the beginning of each project cycle, you will need to create a concept and team roles document, as well a method for documenting/managing your progress.

Your concept document should be at least two but no more than five pages long. You should use Google Docs, and give me access to read and comment on it. (Use my ellics@g.rit.edu account for this). You can then use that document as a design log, as described in the [design log reading for week 1](../readings.md#thursday-126).

You should also implement a project management tool for managing your production process. I recommend either Trello or Hacknplan, both of which are described in the [readings for week 2](../readings.md#thursday-22). 

Here's the scoring sheet I'll use for evaluating your document:

| Description | Max Points | 
| --- | --- |
| Game title/1-line description | 1
| Genre | 1
| Team name and members | 1
| Roles and responsiblities | 1
| Mechanics, rules, win condition | 4
| Concept art / mockups | 2
