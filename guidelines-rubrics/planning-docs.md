# Lawley GDD2: Planning Documents

At the beginning of each project cycle, you will need to create a concept and team roles document, as well a method for documenting/managing your progress.

Your concept document can be stored in either github or Google Drive. If you put it in Google Drive, make sure you give me access to be able to read and comment on it. (Use my ellics@g.rit.edu account for this). You can then use that document as a design log, as described in the [design log reading for week 1](../readings.md#thursday-126).

You should also implement a project management tool for managing your production process. I recommend either Trello or Github Projects, both of which are described in the [readings for week 2](../readings.md#thursday-22).
