# Lawley GDD2: Planning Documents

At the beginning of each project cycle, you will need to create a concept and team roles document, as well a method for documenting/managing your progress.

Your concept document should be at least two but no more than five pages long. I suggest that you use Google Docs, and then use that document as a design log, as described in the [design log reading for week 1](../readings.md#thursday-126).

You should also implement a project management tool for managing your production process. I recommend either Trello or Hacknplan, both of which are described in the [readings for week 2](../readings.md#thursday-22). 

Submit the file to the appropriate dropbox on myCourses no later than the beginning of class on the day it's due. 

Here's the scoring sheet I'll use for evaluating your document:

| Description | Max Points | 
| --- | --- |
| Game title/1-line description | 1
| Genre/platform | 1
| Team name, members, roles & responsiblities | 2
| Description, target audience, & key features  | 4
| Concept art / mockups | 2
