# Lawley GDD2: Peer Evaluations

At the end of each project cycle, you will complete both a peer evaluation of your team members, and a self-assessment of yourself. In addition to giving you a score between 1-10, I will give you individual feedback based on your team's (anonymized) assessment of you, so that you can use that to improve your work in the next cycle.

Download this [peer evaluation form](320-peer-eval.docx), fill it out, and upload it to the Dropbox in myCourses no later than 11:59pm on the Sunday following your project presentations.
