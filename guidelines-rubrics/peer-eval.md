# Lawley GDD2: Peer Evaluations

At the end of each project cycle, you will complete both a peer evaluation of your team members, and a self-assessment of yourself. In addition to giving you a score between 1-10, I will give you individual feedback based on your team's (anonymized) assessment of you, so that you can use that to improve your work in the next cycle.

Peer evaluation forms will become available on [the class peer evaluation site](https://peereval.rit.edu/public_view/course/638281) after the final project presentations of each cycle.
