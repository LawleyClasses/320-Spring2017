# Lawley GDD2: Peer Evaluations

At the end of each project cycle, you will complete a peer evaluation assessing yourself and your team members. 

Peer evaluation forms will become available on [the class peer evaluation site](https://peereval.rit.edu/public_view/course/638281) after the final project presentations of each cycle.
