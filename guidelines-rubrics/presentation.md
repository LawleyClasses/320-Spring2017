# Lawley GDD2: Presentation

At the end of each project cycle, your group will give a presentation of your game. In addition to giving a demo of the game and distributing the [one-page design summary](one-page-design.md), you will also do a post-mortem of the design and development process.

The post-mortem is a time of reflection. Do make a powerpoint presentation, but think IGNITE. The powerpoint should have photographs or screenshots of your game prototype, and in general should focus on images to support your presentation, not on bullet points or blocks of text.

Your presentation should answer the following:
* What is the context/narrative of your game?
* How is the game played? (WalkThrough)
* What are positive aspects of the game?
* What are weaknesses in the game?
* What worked and didn’t work in your team’s workflow, division of responsibilities, and communication?
* What do you plan to do differently going forward with the game and with one another?

You should plan on taking about fifteen minutes for the presentation, after which I'll follow up with questions. It is up to you how to balance responsibility for the presentation--I do not require that all team members speak during the presentation, but I may direct questions at any or all of you during the follow-up.
