## Course Description 
This course continues to examine the core theories of game design as they relate to the professional field. Beginning with a formalized pitch process, this course examines the design and development paradigm from story-boarding and pre-visualization through rapid iteration, refinement, and structured prototyping exercises to further examine the validity of a given design. Specific emphasis is placed on iterative prototyping models, and on methodologies for both informal and formal critique. This course also explores production techniques and life-cycle in the professional industry.

## Course Materials and Communication
There is no required textbook for the course, but there will be an assortment of handouts and online readings that you will receive over the course of the semester. All readings will be linked from this page, in the [Readings section](#Readings). Readings should be completed *before* the class in which the topic is introduced, so that we can use class time to focus on application of the concepts to your projects.

All course materials and example code will be distributed via Github, and you will also be using Git and Github to manage and submit your group project files. 

We will be using [Slack](https://lawleygdd2.slack.com/), a group communication tool, for announcements, discussions, and Q&A about class activities and projects. Both of these tools will be discussed in week 1.

MyCourses will *only* be used for grading, not for distribution of materials or communication. There will be links in myCourses pointing you to this Github repository and to our [class Slack](https://lawleygdd2.slack.com). 

## Course Organization
The course will be organized into three project cycles. In each cycle you will be working with a group to develop a game. The theme will be consistent through the semester, but the groups and the game requirements/constraints will not. Each game we will mix up the groups and start a new project.

## Grading
Your final grade will be based on your three group projects (25% per project), peer evaluations (5% per project), and your overall participation in both class discussions and the project tools (Github and Slack) (10% overall).

I give only three possible final grades in this class. You'll receive a grade of A ("good work!"), C ("you passed, but your work was unimpressive"), or F ("this is the wrong field of study for you"), based on your overall average for the class. Here's the breakdown:

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 83%-100%	| A |
| 65%-82.9%	| C |
| 0-65%	| F |


### Project Deliverables
* **The Prototype** - I do not expect you will succeed in making a great game. I do expect your rules and mechanics to be clear. Basic functionality should work. (It is possible to meet the a win/end condition, players know how they are progressing, rules are clear). (15% per project)
* **One Page Design Doc** - Look and feel is clear, game objective is clear. (5% per project)
* **Post Mortem Writeup** - What did you learn in playtesting? What did you learn in development? What would you do differently? Does the game have potential? Is it viable? What are weaknesses? (5% per project)

### Peer Evaluation
Because this is a team-based course, it is important that you work well together. Additionally, not everyone plays well with others and there are consequences for that: a letter grade's worth. I will ask you to complete an information peer evaluation at the midpoint of each project so that I have an opportunity to provide feedback before the project cycle ends. Only the end-of-project peer evaluation will count towards your grade. 

### Attendance & Participation
Because class time will be used not just for group work, but also for me to provide your groups with ongoing feedback, attendance is critical. It is also important that you participate in group discussions in the class Slack, and that you contribute to the materials in each of your projects' Github repositories.

## Additional Policies

### Important RIT Deadlines
- Last day of add/drop is 30 January 2017.
- Last day to withdraw with a grade of “W” is 21 April 2017.

### Communication
Any updates to assignments and any emails that I need to send to individual students will be done through MyCourses. This means you should regularly check your email and the Slack for this course. I check both email and Slack frequently, and will try to always respond within 24 hours (the exception to this is when I’m traveling, for which I’ll give you advance notice). You will get a faster response using Slack, with the bonus that other people in the class can help answer questions, as well. Please send mail to me using your RIT account, and include the course number (110) in your subject line—that will significantly improve my response time!
### Late Policy
If you are having problems with an assignment or have an emergency that may make you late in submitting your work, please contact me before the due date. Late assignments that have not been cleared with me before the due date may not be accepted, or will include a grade penalty. 
### Missed Classes
If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to check with classmates for notes. I will not recap classes for you. Because your lowest quiz grades are automatically dropped, I will not give make-up quizzes if you miss one. 
### Office Hours
I will have a minimum of four office hours per week. This is an excellent time to come in with questions on the course material, homework, or in class work. I am always happy to help you understand the course material or assignments—or just to chat about whatever topic you’d like. Take advantage of this time, since few students bother to talk with their professors outside of class. If for some reason I’m called away during office hours, there will be a note on the door. 
### Mobile Phones 
Please turn off sounds on your phone, so that you don’t disturb the people around you with notification noises. If you must take a call, please leave the room to do so. 
### Notices of Accommodation
If you have a “Notice of Accommodation”, I should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class or during my office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met. 
### Social Networks
I don’t initiate friend requests on Facebook, because I don’t want you to feel obligated to accept. However, I do generally accept friend requests from students. I have a private Twitter account that I seldom use, and don’t accept follower requests on it. I maintain a LinkedIn account, and am happy to connect with students there in order to help them find job-related connections. Links to my various social media accounts can be found on my website (lawley.rit.edu). 
### Policy on Incomplete Grades
Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, and then only by prior arrangement with me. Note that I only give incompletes in the event of: 1) military deployment or 2) documented and verifiable family or personal illness/emergency. Being overcommitted, overwhelmed, and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework does not fall into either of those two categories. Please come see me ASAP if you’re having difficulty so we can find a solution together. 
### Academic Dishonesty
My policy on academic dishonesty is simple: If you get caught cheating or plagiarizing, you get an “F” as a grade for the course, a letter detailing the incident goes into your records folder, and you are immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.)

Please review RIT’s policy on academic dishonesty:
