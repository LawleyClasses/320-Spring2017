## Course Description 
This course continues to examine the core theories of game design as they relate to the professional field. Beginning with a formalized pitch process, this course examines the design and development paradigm from story-boarding and pre-visualization through rapid iteration, refinement, and structured prototyping exercises to further examine the validity of a given design. Specific emphasis is placed on iterative prototyping models, and on methodologies for both informal and formal critique. This course also explores production techniques and life-cycle in the professional industry.

## Course Materials and Communication
There is no required textbook for the course, but there will be an assortment of handouts and online readings that you will receive over the course of the semester. All readings will be listed on the [readings.md](readings.md) file here in Github. Most will be available on the open web, but a handful are copyrighted materials that will be uploaded to the content section of myCourses. Readings should be completed *before* the class in which the topic is introduced, so that we can use class time to focus on application of the concepts to your projects.

All course materials will be distributed via Github, and you will also be using Git and Github to manage and submit your group project files.  We will be using Slack, a group communication tool, for announcements, discussions, and Q&A about class activities and projects. Both of these tools will be discussed in week 1.

MyCourses will *only* be used for grading and for distributing copyrighted readings. There will be links in myCourses pointing you back to this Github repository and to our [class Slack](https://lawleygdd2.slack.com). 

## Course Organization
The course will be organized into three project cycles (a 4.5-week analog game cycle, and two 5-week digital game cycles). In each cycle you will be working with a group to develop a game. Groups will stay the same throughout the semester, but the requirements and constraints for each game cycle will change.  

All three of your games will be based in some way on the [Genesee Country Village & Museum](http://gcv.org), a local historical site that [RIT has recently entered into a partnership with](https://www.rit.edu/news/story.php?id=56642). We will have representatives from the site visit class in week 2, and they will also provide feedback on your games. I will be arranging a field trip for the class to visit the site, as well. 

## Grading
Your final grade will be based on your three game projects (25% per project), peer evaluations (5% per project), and your overall participation in both in-class discussions and Slack) (10% overall).

I give only three possible final grades in this class. You'll receive a grade of A ("good work!"), C ("you passed, but your work was unimpressive"), or F ("this is the wrong field of study for you"), based on your overall average for the class. Here's the breakdown:

| Class Average | Grade |
| ------------- | ----- |
| 83%-100%	| A |
| 65%-82.9%	| C |
| 0-65%	| F |


## Projects

### Project Cycles

Playtests will take place on Tuesdays; by Thursday the team should have written up and reflected on the playtest feedback so that by the end of class Thursday you've clearly designated tasks for the next iteration. Peer evals will be done after all other deliverables have been submitted. 

* Week 1: Ideation, Concept Document, Role Assignment
* Week 2: First prototype developed
* Week 3: Playtest & iterate
* Week 4: Playtest & iterate
* Week 5: Final tweaks and presentation of prototype and one-page design summary 

### Project Deliverables

* **[Planning Documents](guidelines-rubrics/planning-docs.md)** - You will need to create documentation to manage your planning and production process for each project. Due at start of second week in each cycle. (5% per project)
* **[The Prototype](guidelines-rubics/prototype.md)** - I do not expect that you will succeed in making a great game. I do expect that your rules and mechanics will be clear, and that the game be functional and playable. Due at last class of cycle. (10% per project)
* **[One Page Design Summary](guidelines-rubrics/one-page-design.md)** - Your group will create and present a one-page design summary document that encapsulates both the look and feel of your game and its basic functionality. Due at last class of cycle. (5% per project)
* **[Presentation](guidelines-rubrics/presentation.md)** - What did you learn in playtesting? What did you learn in development? What would you do differently? Does the game have potential? Is it viable? What are its weaknesses? Due at last class of cycle. (5% per project)
* **[Peer Evaluation](guidelines-rubrics/peer-eval.md)** - Because this is a team-based course, it is important that you work well together. Additionally, not everyone plays well with others and there are consequences for that: a letter grade's worth. So that you have an opportunity learn and grow from team feedback, you will complete both a peer and a self evaluation at the end of each project cycle. Due Sunday after cycle ends. (5% per project)

## Attendance & Participation
Because class time will be used not just for group work, but also for me to talk about key concepts and to provide your groups with ongoing feedback, attendance is critical. It is also important that you participate in group discussions in the class Slack, and that you contribute to the materials in each of your projects' Github repositories. I will be assessing this weekly.

## Additional Policies

### Important RIT Deadlines
- Last day of add/drop is 30 January 2017.
- Last day to withdraw with a grade of “W” is 21 April 2017.
- You have one semester after a class ends to challenge your final grade.

### Communication
Any updates to assignments or the syllabus will be posted in Github and automatically announced in Slack. Announcements (such as class cancellations) will be posted in Slack. This means you should regularly check Slack, and consider setting up notifications for the announcements channel. I check both email and Slack frequently, and will try to always respond within 24 hours (the exception to this is when I’m traveling, for which I’ll give you advance notice). You will get a faster response using Slack, with the bonus that other people in the class can help answer questions, as well. If you use email, please make sure you send the message from your RIT account to my RIT account (Elizabeth dot Lawley @ rit dot edu).

### Late Policy
If you are having problems with an assignment or have an emergency that may make you late in submitting your work, please contact me before the due date. Late assignments that have not been cleared with me before the due date may not be accepted, or will include a grade penalty.

### Missed Classes
If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to check with classmates for notes. (I recommend using Slack for this.) I will not recap classes for you.  

### Office Hours
I will have a minimum of four office hours per week. This is an excellent time to come in with questions on the course material, homework, or in class work. I am always happy to help you understand the course material or assignments—or just to chat about whatever topic you’d like. Take advantage of this time, since few students bother to talk with their professors outside of class. If for some reason I’m called away during office hours, there will be a note on the door. 

### Mobile Phones 
Please turn off sounds on your phone, so that you don’t disturb the people around you with notification noises. If you must take a call, please leave the room to do so. 

### Notices of Accommodation
If you have a “Notice of Accommodation”, I should have received a copy electronically. Please discuss this with me after class or during my office hours, so that I can make sure all of your accommodations are met. 

### Social Networks
I don’t initiate friend requests on Facebook, because I don’t want you to feel obligated to accept. However, I do generally accept friend requests from students. I have a private Twitter account that I seldom use, and don’t accept follower requests on it. I maintain a LinkedIn account, and am happy to connect with students there in order to help them find job-related connections. Links to my various social media accounts can be found on my website (lawley.rit.edu). 

### Policy on Incomplete Grades
Incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional circumstances, and then only by prior arrangement with me. Note that I only give incompletes in the event of: 1) military deployment or 2) documented and verifiable family or personal illness/emergency. Being overcommitted, overwhelmed, and/or not having enough time to complete your coursework does not fall into either of those two categories. Please come see me ASAP if you’re having difficulty so we can find a solution together. 

### Academic Dishonesty
My policy on academic dishonesty is simple: If you get caught cheating or plagiarizing, you get an “F” as a grade for the course, a letter detailing the incident goes into your records folder, and you are immediately removed from the class. (If this is a second occurrence during your career at RIT, the penalties are harsher.)

Please review RIT’s policy on academic dishonesty: 
http://www.rit.edu/~w-policy/sectionD/D8.html 

### Discrimination and Harassment
RIT is committed to providing a safe learning environment, free of harassment and discrimination as articulated in our university policies located on our governance website.  RIT’s policies require faculty to share information about incidents of gender based discrimination and harassment with RIT’s Title IX coordinator or deputy coordinators, regardless whether the incidents are stated to them in person or shared by students as part of their coursework.
